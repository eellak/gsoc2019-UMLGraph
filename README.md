# UMLGraph - Declarative Drawing of UML Diagrams

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dspinellis/UMLGraph.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dspinellis/UMLGraph)

*UMLGraph* allows the declarative specification and drawing of UML diagrams.
You can browse the system's documentation
through [this link](http://www.spinellis.gr/umlgraph/doc/index.html),
or print it through [this link](http://www.spinellis.gr/umlgraph/doc/indexw.html).

In order to run *UMLGraph*, you need to have [GraphViz](https://www.graphviz.org/)
installed in your system path. On most Linux distributions, this can be easily
installed using the regular package manager.

To compile the Java doclet from the source code run *ant* on the
*build.xml* file.

If you change the source code, you can run regression tests by
executing *ant test*.

Visit the project's [home page](http://www.spinellis.gr/umlgraph) for more information.

## Compatibility

Currently, only Java 8 is supported by the Doclet.

In Java 9 the JavaDoc Doclet API changed substantially, and the doclet therefore
needs to be largely rewritten.

Sorry, this has not happened yet - volunteers for this task are welcome.

## Development versions

In order to use development versions, you can use [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#dspinellis/UMLGraph/master-SNAPSHOT).
Note that as this is compiled on demand, you may sometimes see a "Read timed out" when the package is recompiled,
and it should be fine a few seconds later. And because the master branch can change any time, you may want to use
a versioned snapshot instead (see the Jitpack documentation for details).

**Gradle**:
```
repositories { maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' } }
configurations { umlgraph }
dependencies { umlgraph 'com.github.dspinellis:UMLGraph:master-SNAPSHOT' }
javadoc {
  doclet = 'org.umlgraph.doclet.UmlGraphDoc'
  docletpath = configurations.umlgraph.files.asType(List)
  tags("hidden:X", "opt:X", "has:X", "navhas:X", "assoc:X", "navassoc:X",
       "composed:X", "navcomposed:X", "stereotype:X", "depend:X")
}
```

**Maven**:
```
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>

## GSoC 2019 - Contributions

All the work that needs to be done through the GSoC 2019 will be presented in this section. The main task for this year's GSoC is to update the UMLGraph tool by making it fully functional using the latest jdk.javadoc.doclet doclet API instead of the com.sun.javadoc API that is now being used. In order to achieve that, several changes need to be done on the existing code, which are going to be presented thoroughly here in the next three months. Relevant and necessary information about those APIs are shown in the documentation links below

**com.sun.javadoc**: <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/jdk/api/javadoc/doclet/com/sun/javadoc/package-summary.html>   
**jdk.javadoc.doclet**: <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/jdk/javadoc/doclet/package-summary.html>

### Constructor method of class ClassGraph
The constructor of the class ClassGraph has changed from public ClassGraph(RootDoc root, OptionProvider orptionProvider, Doc contextDoc){} to public ClassGraph(TypeElement root, OptionProvider orptionProvider, Element contextDoc). Of course furhter changes have been made to the lines of code within the brackets of the constructor.
